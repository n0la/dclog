
 The general coding styles are the same as C# uses with one difference:
 
  o No tabs, instead spaces are used to indent.
  o Indent width is 2 spaces.
 
 In Visual C# Express 2010 go to Tools -> Options. Select the checkbox saying
 "Show all settings" and go to "Text Editor" -> "C#" -> "Tabs". There you can 
 set the indent size and tab size to 2, and select the option to insert spaces.

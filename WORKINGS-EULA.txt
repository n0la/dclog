 How does this violate the EULA? Well let's first begin on how this application
 works:
 
 This application replaces (at runtime - i.e. while the game is running) a
 method the game uses with a self written one. So everytime the game tries to
 use this method, the self written one is invoked instead. It can only achieve
 this by changing the games memory. Once this redirection has been installed,
 the application filters all the messages it receives (and they are a lot) to
 only include the combat log. Such combat log messages are then processed 
 further.
 
 This application does not attempt to change any other memory in the game, 
 except for this redirection it creates. It does not read passwords, private 
 data, execute cheats, or installs a virus or backdoor.
 
 Yet, the redirection violates the EULA. Here we go:
 
 > 9. You will not attempt to interfere with, hack into, or decipher any 
 > transmissions to or from the Game or any aspect of the Game.
 
 Since "any apsect of the Game" is very vague, this application surely violated
 this term because it "hacked" into the game to install the redirection. While
 the technical solution surely is not "hacking" as many people know it, I am 
 pretty sure you can interpret it that way.

 Here we go: This application definitely falls under "data gathering utilities".

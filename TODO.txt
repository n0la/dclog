
 A general TODO list for this project:
 
 MUST HAVE
 
  o Working average DPS meter across different monsters, showing how much
    damage you currently do.
  o Exporting graphs and data to file so others can view and you can view it
    later.
  o DDO client support for German and French versions.

 NICE TO HAVE

  o Hook DLL written in C so it does not slow down the game. Perhaps a better 
    way to deploy and hook DDO, like a service running in the background. Care
	must be taken not to break the i18n support DDO offers through using wide
	character strings.
  o XP/min graph.
  o The application should automatically write the combat log to file as well as
    parse it for its own use.
